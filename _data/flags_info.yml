    to maleness, femaleness, or neutrality.</p>

    Generally speaking, neutrois is a transsexual identity, meaning that it involves
    gender dysphoria and a desire to make a physical transition to a gender neutral
    presentation. However, as a result of the diversity of people who identify as
    neutrois, some of them say they don't have one or more of those traits, and are
    no less neutrois for it. What is agreed upon is that neutrois is a nonbinary gender
    identity, and that people of any gender assigned at birth can have this identity.
    Also, a person of any cultural or ethnic background can call themself neutrois.</p>

    parties involved and consent to their involvement. Polyamory can be as simple
    as an open relationship or it can be three or more people who are all in a relationship
    with each other. Polyamorous is not a sexuality on its own, but more of a description
    on how one can experience attraction. Polyamorous people can have any sexuality.</p>

    relationships in the sense that partners agree not to have any sexual and/or romantic
    relations outside the current members of the group. One might think of polyfidelity
